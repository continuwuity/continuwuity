# Calls

Matrix supports two types of calls:

- Element Call powered by MatrixRTC
- Legacy calls, usually using Jitsi

Both types of calls are supported by different sets of clients, but most clients are moving towards MatrixRTC / Element Call.

For either one to work correctly, you have to do some additional setup.

- For legacy calls to work, you need to set up a TURN/STUN server. [Read the TURN guide for tips on how to set up coturn](./calls/turn.mdx)
- For MatrixRTC to work, you have to set up the LiveKit backend (foci). LiveKit also uses TURN/STUN to increase reliability, so you might want to configure your TURN server first. [Read the LiveKit guide](./calls/livekit.mdx)

:::warning
Element X is known to not be able to do calls on Continwuity. [Track this bug to get updated when the issue is fixed](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues/1306)
