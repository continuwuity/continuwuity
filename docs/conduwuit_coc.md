# Continuwuity Community Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Continuwuity community! We’re excited to have you here. Continuwuity is
a hard-fork of the Conduit homeserver, aimed at making Matrix more accessible
and inclusive for everyone.

This space is dedicated to fostering a positive, supportive, and inclusive
environment for everyone. This Code of Conduct applies to all Continuwuity spaces,
including any further community rooms that reference this CoC. Here are our
guidelines to help maintain the welcoming atmosphere that sets Continuwuity apart.

For the general foundational rules, please refer to the [Contributor's
Covenant](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/src/branch/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Below are additional guidelines specific to the Continuwuity community.

## Our Values and Guidelines

1. **Respect and Inclusivity**: We are committed to maintaining a community
   where everyone feels safe and respected. Discrimination, harassment, or hate
speech of any kind will not be tolerated. Recognise that each community member
experiences the world differently based on their past experiences, background,
and identity. Share your own experiences and be open to learning about others'
diverse perspectives.

2. **Positivity and Constructiveness**: Engage in constructive discussions and
   support each other. If you feel angry, negative, or aggressive, take a break
until you can participate in a positive and constructive manner. Process intense
feelings with a friend or in a private setting before engaging in community
conversations to help maintain a supportive and focused environment.

3. **Clarity and Understanding**: Our community includes neurodivergent
   individuals and those who may not appreciate sarcasm or subtlety. Communicate
clearly and kindly, avoiding sarcasm and ensuring your messages are easily
understood by all. Additionally, avoid putting the burden of education on
marginalized groups by doing your own research before asking for explanations.

4. **Be Open to Inclusivity**: Actively engage in conversations about making our
   community more inclusive. Report discriminatory behavior to the moderators
and be open to constructive feedback that aims to improve our community.
Understand that discussing discrimination and negative experiences can be
emotionally taxing, so focus on the message rather than critiquing the tone
used.

5. **Commit to Inclusivity**: Building an inclusive community requires time,
   energy, and resources. Recognise that addressing discrimination and bias is
an ongoing process that necessitates commitment and action from all community
members.

## Matrix Community

This Code of Conduct applies to the entire [Continuwuity Matrix
Space](https://matrix.to/#/#space:continuwuity.org) and its rooms,
including:

### [#continuwuity:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#continuwuity:continuwuity.org)

This room is for support and discussions about Continuwuity. Ask questions, share
insights, and help each other out.

### [#offtopic:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#offtopic:continuwuity.org)

For off-topic community conversations about any subject. While this room allows
for a wide range of topics, the same CoC applies. Keep discussions respectful
and inclusive, and avoid divisive subjects like country/world politics. General
topics, such as world events, are welcome as long as they follow the CoC.

### [#dev:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dev:continuwuity.org)

This room is dedicated to discussing active development of Continuwuity. Posting
requires an elevated power level, which can be requested in one of the other
rooms. Use this space to collaborate and innovate.

## Enforcement

We have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of this Code of Conduct. If
someone’s behavior makes you uncomfortable, please report it to the moderators.
Actions we may take include:

1. **Warning**: A warning given directly in the room or via a private message
   from the moderators, identifying the violation and requesting corrective
action.
2. **Temporary Mute**: Temporary restriction from participating in discussions
   for a specified period to allow for reflection and cooling off.
3. **Kick or Ban**: Egregious behavior may result in an immediate kick or ban to
   protect other community members. Bans are considered permanent and will only
be reversed in exceptional circumstances after proven good behavior.

Please highlight issues directly in rooms when possible, but if you don't feel
comfortable doing that, then please send a DM to one of the moderators directly.

Together, let’s build a community where everyone feels valued and respected.
