# Continuwuity for FreeBSD

Continuwuity currently does not provide FreeBSD builds or FreeBSD packaging. However, Continuwuity does build and work on FreeBSD using the system-provided RocksDB.

Contributions to get Continuwuity packaged for FreeBSD are welcome.

Please join our [Continuwuity BSD](https://matrix.to/#/%23bsd:continuwuity.org) community room.
