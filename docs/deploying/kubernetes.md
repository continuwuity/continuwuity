# Continuwuity for Kubernetes

Continuwuity doesn't support horizontal scalability or distributed loading
natively, however a community maintained Helm Chart is available here to run
conduwuit on Kubernetes: <https://gitlab.cronce.io/charts/conduwuit>

This should be compatible with continuwuity, but you will need to change the image reference.

Should changes need to be made, please reach out to the maintainer as this is not maintained/controlled by the Continuwuity maintainers.
