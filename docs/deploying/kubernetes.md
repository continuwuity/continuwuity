# Continuwuity for Kubernetes

Continuwuity doesn't support horizontal scalability or distributed loading
natively. However, a community-maintained Helm Chart is available here to run
conduwuit on Kubernetes: <https://gitlab.cronce.io/charts/conduwuit>

This should be compatible with Continuwuity, but you will need to change the image reference.

If changes need to be made, please reach out to the maintainer, as this is not maintained or controlled by the Continuwuity maintainers.
