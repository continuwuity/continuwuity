# Partnered Homeserver Operator Requirements
> _So you want to be an officially sanctioned public Continuwuity homeserver operator?_

Thank you for your interest in the project! There's a few things we need from you first to make sure your homeserver meets our quality standards and that you are prepared to handle the additional workload introduced by operating a public chat service.

## Stuff you must have
if you don't do these things we will tell you to go away

- Your homeserver must be running an up-to-date version of Continuwuity
- You must have a CAPTCHA, external registration system, or apply-to-join system that provides one-time-use invite codes (we do not accept fully open nor static token registration)
- Your homeserver must have support details listed in [`/.well-known/matrix/support`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.17/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixsupport)
- Your rules and guidelines must align with [the project's own code of conduct](guidelines).
- You must be reasonably responsive (i.e. don't leave us hanging for a week if we alert you to an issue on your server)
- Your homeserver's community rooms (if any) must be protected by a moderation bot subscribed to policy lists like the Community Moderation Effort (you can get one from https://asgard.chat if you don't want to run your own)

## Stuff we encourage you to have
not strictly required but we will consider your request more strongly if you have it

- You should have automated moderation tooling that can automatically suspend abusive users on your homeserver who are added to policy lists
- You should have multiple server administrators (increased bus factor)
- You should have a terms of service and privacy policy prominently available

## Stuff you get

- Prominent listing in our README!
- A gold star sticker
- Access to a low noise room for more direct communication with maintainers and collaboration with fellow operators
- Read-only access to the continuwuity internal ban list
- Early notice of upcoming releases

## Sound good?
To get started, ping a team member in [our main chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#continuwuity:continuwuity.org) and ask to be added to the list.
