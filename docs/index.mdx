## What is Continuwuity?

Continuwuity is a Matrix homeserver.

Matrix is an open chat network that lets anyone talk to anyone, no matter what server or address they use - sort of like email.

Continuwuity receives and keeps track of all your messages, and delivers what you send to the right people.

## Why is Continuwuity different?

Continuwuity is light and fast, using a fraction of the memory of other major homeservers. It's also simple to set up, and secure by default.

We are a community run project, filled with diverse and friendly people. Everything is built by people who care about the project volunteering their free time.
