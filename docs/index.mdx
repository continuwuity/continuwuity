## Why continuwuity?

- **Improve compatibility**: Better Matrix specification compliance
- **Fix issues**: Address bugs and performance problems from the original
- **Add features**: Implement missing capabilities requested by administrators
- **Document thoroughly**: Comprehensive guides for setup and maintenance
- **Foster community**: Create a sustainable, welcoming development environment
