            "message": "It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's 0.5.0-rc.8.1!\n\nThis is a minor bugfix update to the rc8 which backports some important fixes from the latest main branch. If you still haven't updated to rc8, you should skip to main. Otherwise, you should upgrade to this bugfix release as soon as possible.\n\nBugfixes backported to this version:\n\n- Resolved several issues with state resolution v2.1 (room version 12)\n- Fixed issues with the `restricted` and `knock_restricted` join rules that would sometimes incorrectly disallow a valid join\n- Fixed the automatic support contact listing being a no-op\n- Fixed upgrading pre-v12 rooms to v12 rooms\n- Fixed policy servers sending the incorrect JSON objects (resulted in false positives)\n- Fixed debug build panic during MSC4133 migration\n\nIt is recommended, if you can and are comfortable with doing so, following updates to the main branch - we're in the run up to the full 0.5.0 release, and more and more bugfixes and new features are being pushed constantly. Please don't forget to join [#announcements:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#announcements:continuwuity.org) to receive this news faster and be alerted to other important updates!"
