Added support for issuing additional registration tokens, stored in the database, which supplement the existing registration token hardcoded in the config file. These tokens may optionally expire after a certain number of uses or after a certain amount of time has passed. Additionally, the `registration_token_file` configuration option is superseded by this feature and **has been removed**. Contributed by @ginger
