=== when we receive these events ===
A1
A2 --> A1
A3 --> A2
=== then we arrange into this order ===
# Given the server has some existing events in this order:
A1*
A2*
A3*

=== when we receive these events ===
# And after a netsplit the server receives some unrelated events, which refer to
# some unknown event, because the server didn't receive all of them:
B7 --> B6
B8 --> B7
B9 --> B8

=== then we arrange into this order ===
# Then these events are new, and we add a gap to show something is missing:
A1
A2
A3
-B6*
B7*
B8*
B9*
=== when we receive these events ===
# Then if we backfill and receive more of those events later:
B4 --> B3
B5 --> B4
B6 --> B5
=== then we arrange into this order ===
# They are slotted into the gap, and a new gap is created to represent the
# still-missing events:
A1
A2
A3
-B3
B4
B5
B6
B7
B8
B9
=== and we notify about these gaps ===
B6
